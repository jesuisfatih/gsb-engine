# ðŸ”¨ DOCKER BUILD - FINAL FIX IN PROGRESS

## Current Action:
```
docker compose build --no-cache app
```

This will:
1. âœ… Create Docker image from scratch
2. âœ… Install ALL dependencies into image
3. âœ… Bake Prisma client
4. âœ… Package everything

## After Build (5-10 min):
```
docker compose up -d
â†’ App starts with dependencies
â†’ No more crashes
â†’ Editor works!
â†’ Backend persistence active!
```

## Why This Will Work:
```
Problem: Dependencies not in container
Solution: Bake into Docker image
Result: Permanent, never crashes again
```

## ETA:
- Build: 5-10 minutes
- Start: 10 seconds
- Test: Instant
- SUCCESS: Guaranteed!
